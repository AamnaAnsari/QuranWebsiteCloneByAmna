Project Title: Quran Website Clone

Description: This project involved cloning a Quran-themed website, ensuring it is fully responsive and interactive.
The website features a user-friendly interface, easy navigation, and optimized design for various screen sizes.
I focused on implementing animations for smooth transitions and engaging user experience.
The project highlights my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a keen emphasis on responsiveness and visual appeal.
This clone is designed to provide a seamless experience across devices, making the Quran accessible with elegant functionality.
